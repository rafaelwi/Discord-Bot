Version 2.1
# Purpose
This is a Discord bot intended to provide entertainment to users of the
University of Guelph Bachelor of Computer Science Discord server.

# Features
The initial purpose of the bot was to provide a method by which students taking the same
electives could instantly create or join private message channels within the server
via commands and help each other prepare for tests/assignments while keeping the server
clutter-free for everyone else.

The bot comes with a series of games, including black jack,
Russian Roulette, and tic tac toe. These games reward users with a currency
known as GryphCoins that can be spent on cosmetic changes to their profile.

There is also a karma system, allowing users to upvote and downvote each
other's messages based on productivity.

Scorekeeping, karma data, and other information about how users interact with
the bot is all stored on a MariaDB server hosted on Google Cloud Platform.
Updates to the database are made using SQL instructions.
